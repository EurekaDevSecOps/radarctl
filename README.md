## Overview

**Radar CLI** is a developer-friendly command-line tool that orchestrates multiple application security scanners ‚Äî for code, dependencies, and secrets ‚Äî in one unified workflow.  

With Radar CLI, you can:
- Run **SAST**, **SCA**, and **secret scanning** locally or in CI/CD pipelines.
- Generate **unified SARIF reports** compatible with GitHub Advanced Security.
- Optionally upload results to **Eureka ASPM** for centralized tracking, deduplication, and prioritization.

---

Telemetry is **off by default** ‚Äî nothing is uploaded unless you explicitly enable it.

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 22.17.0 or higher  
- **Docker** (for containerized scanners)

---

## Installation

Install globally using **npm**:

```bash
npm i -g @eurekadevsecops/radar
````

Verify the installation:

```bash
radar --version
```

---

## Getting Started

Run the CLI to view available commands:

```bash
radar
```

Example output:

```
COMMANDS
  help      display help
  scan      scan for vulnerabilities
  scanners  display available scanners
```

You can view help for any command:

```bash
radar help scan
```

---

## Running a Scan

To scan the current working directory:

```bash
radar scan
```

You can also specify scanners:

```bash
radar scan -s "opengrep,gitleaks,grype"
```

To output a SARIF report:

```bash
radar scan -s "opengrep,gitleaks,grype" -o report.sarif
```

---

## Supported Scanners

| Category          | Scanners       | Description                                     |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **SAST**          | Opengrep       | Detects insecure code patterns                  |
| **Secrets**       | Gitleaks       | Finds hardcoded credentials                     |
| **SCA**           | Grype, DepScan | Detects vulnerable dependencies                 |
| **Container/IaC** | (coming soon)  | Scans Dockerfiles, Terraform, and K8s manifests |

---

## Telemetry & Privacy

Telemetry is **off by default**.
Radar does **not** send any data externally unless you explicitly provide:

* `EUREKA_AGENT_TOKEN`
* `EUREKA_PROFILE`

When provided:

* Findings are securely uploaded to **Eureka ASPM**
* You gain **dashboards, trend analysis, and contextual prioritization**

When omitted:

* Scans remain **fully local**, ideal for open source and air-gapped environments

---

## Example Workflows

### Local Scan (no uploads)

Perfect for open source and private projects ‚Äî 100% local execution.

```bash
radar scan -s "opengrep,gitleaks,grype"
```

### Upload Findings to Eureka ASPM

See all findings in one place with deduplication, trend tracking, and risk prioritization.

```bash
export EUREKA_AGENT_TOKEN=<your token>
export EUREKA_PROFILE=my-service

radar scan -s "opengrep,gitleaks,grype" -o report.sarif --upload
```

### Upload to GitHub Advanced Security

If your repo uses **GHAS**, Radar‚Äôs SARIF output can be uploaded directly:

```bash
radar scan -s "opengrep,gitleaks,grype" -o report.sarif
gh code-scanning upload --sarif report.sarif
```
