## Overview

**Radar CLI** is a command-line tool that orchestrates multiple application security scanners ‚Äî for code, dependencies, and secrets ‚Äî in one unified package. We've put a lot of effort into making Radar CLI easy to use for developers and easy to integrate into CI/CD pipelines. Check out our accompanying [GitHub Action for Radar CLI](https://github.com/EurekaDevSecOps/scan-action).

With Radar CLI, you can:
- Run **SAST**, **SCA**, and **secret scanning** locally or in CI/CD pipelines.
- Generate **unified SARIF reports** compatible with industry-standard security and vulnerability analysis tools.
- Optionally upload results to **Eureka ASPM** for centralized tracking, deduplication, and prioritization.

---

Telemetry is **off by default** ‚Äî nothing is uploaded unless you explicitly enable it.

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 22.17.0 or higher  
- **Docker** (for containerized scanners)

---

## Installation

Install globally using **npm**:

```bash
npm i -g @eurekadevsecops/radar
````

Verify the installation:

```bash
radar --version
```

---

## Getting Started

Run the CLI to view available commands:

```bash
radar
```

Example output:

```
COMMANDS
  help      display help
  scan      scan for vulnerabilities
  scanners  display available scanners
```

You can view help for any command:

```bash
radar help scan
```

---

## Running a Scan

To scan the current working directory:

```bash
radar scan
```

You can also specify scanners to use:

```bash
radar scan -s "opengrep,gitleaks,grype"
```

Output a SARIF report:

```bash
radar scan -s "opengrep,gitleaks,grype" -o report.sarif
```

---

### More on the `radar scan` command

Scans your source code and dependencies for vulnerabilities.
If no target is specified, the current working directory is scanned.

```bash
USAGE
  radar scan [OPTIONS] [TARGET]
```

**OPTIONS**

| Option             | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-c, --categories` | List of scanner categories (e.g. `sast`, `sca`, `secrets`). Defaults to `all`.                      |
| `-s, --scanners`   | Comma-separated list of scanners to run. Use `radar scanners` to list available ones.               |
| `-o, --output`     | Output findings into a SARIF file.                                                                  |
| `-d, --debug`      | Log detailed debug info to stdout.                                                                  |
| `-q, --quiet`      | Suppress stdout logging (except errors).                                                            |
| `-f, --format`     | Output format for severity display: `security` (high/moderate/low) or `sarif` (error/warning/note). |
| `-e, --escalate`   | Treat specified lower severities as high (e.g. `--escalate=moderate,low`).                          |

**PARAMETERS**

| Parameter | Description                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TARGET`  | (Optional) Path to scan. Defaults to current directory. |

#### Category and Scanner Selection

* `--categories` lets you run all scanners in one or more categories.
  Example: `--categories=sca,sast`
* `--scanners` lets you choose specific scanners by name.
  Example: `--scanners=opengrep,depscan`
* Both can be combined ‚Äî Radar CLI will run scanners that match *both* filters.

#### Severity Formats

| Format     | Example Severities     |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| `security` | high / moderate / low  |
| `sarif`    | error / warning / note |

You can also **escalate severities**:

```bash
radar scan -f sarif -e warning,note
# Treat warnings and notes as errors
```

#### Exit Codes

An exit code of `0` means the scan passed with no issues. Any other code means the scan failed ‚Äî either due to findings or an error.

| Code    | Meaning                                 |
| ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `0`     | Clean and successful scan.              |
| `1`     | Invalid command, arguments, or options. |
| `8‚Äì15`  | New vulnerabilities found.              |
| `>=16`  | Aborted due to unexpected error.        |

#### Examples

Scan current directory:
```bash
radar scan
```

Scan a specific path:
```bash
radar scan /my/repo/dir
```

Save findings into a SARIF file:
```bash
radar scan -o scan.sarif
```

Run only dependency and code scanners:
```bash
radar scan -c sca,sast
```

Run specific scanners:
```bash
radar scan -s depscan,opengrep
```

Enable debug logs:
```bash
radar scan --debug
```

Quiet mode (errors only):
```bash
radar scan --quiet
```

Display findings in SARIF-style severities:
```bash
radar scan -f sarif
```

Escalate lower severities:
```bash
radar scan -e moderate,low
```

---

## Telemetry & Privacy

Telemetry is **off by default**.
Radar does **not** send any data externally unless you explicitly provide:

* `EUREKA_AGENT_TOKEN`
* `EUREKA_PROFILE`

When provided:

* Findings are securely uploaded to **Eureka ASPM**
* You gain **dashboards, trend analysis, and contextual prioritization**

When omitted:

* Scans remain **fully local**

---

## Example Workflows

### Local Scan (no uploads)

Perfect for open source and private projects ‚Äî 100% local execution.

```bash
radar scan -s "opengrep,gitleaks,grype"
```

### Upload Findings to Eureka ASPM

See all findings in one place with deduplication, trend tracking, and risk prioritization.

```bash
export EUREKA_AGENT_TOKEN=<your token>
export EUREKA_PROFILE=<your profile ID>

radar scan -s "opengrep,gitleaks,grype" -o report.sarif
```

| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚ùå `report.sarif` not found                   | Scan failed or invalid scanner list | Check scanner names and ensure Docker is running          |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è No findings uploaded                       | Missing or invalid token/profile    | Set `EUREKA_AGENT_TOKEN` and `EUREKA_PROFILE`             |
| üß± `radar: command not found`                 | CLI not installed globally          | Run `npm i -g @eurekadevsecops/radar` again               |
